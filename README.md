# Goofy Text

This is a fun, simple JavaScript project that takes a user's text and alternates the
capitalization of each letter and adding a space in between them. "I"'s are automatically
made lower-case, while "L"'s are automatically made upper-case for optimal readability.

The main functionality of this app was created in less than 30 minutes using ChatGPT prompts,
while the UI/UX gradually took form.

# Problem

My girlfriend and I, who are dating long-distance, have a running joke where we type in a 
way that indicates the use of a goofy tone of voice. It was a way to bridge the 
gap of communication over texting to supplement our use of emojis and gifs.

For example:

"Of course that's what your meant!" -->  "O f   c O u R s E   T h A t ' s   w H a T   Y o U r   m E a N t!" <br>
"Oh really now?" --> "O h   r E a L L Y   N o W?" <br>
"Wow you are so funny!" --> " w O w   y O u   a R e   s O   F u N n Y ! " <br>

(I actually used the app for those examples!)

# Solution

Without the app, manually typing the "goofy text" is cumbersome and time consuming, which results in not
being able to be completed and sent in a timely, comedic manner. So I developed this app so that it is ready
to be used for quick, fun-filled messaging. ðŸ˜œ
